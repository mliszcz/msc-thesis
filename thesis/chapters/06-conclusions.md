# Conclusions

This chapter concludes the thesis, the performed research and the delivered
solution.

The work presented in this thesis had two mail goals: to evaluate existing
solutions for building web-based TANGO applications and to bring modern web
development techniques to the TANGO web clients. The evaluation have showed
that there is only one solution which acheived success and is recognized by
the TANGO community. However, due to some disputable assumptions and design
decisions, it may be not suitable for everyone. The TangoJS proposed here
tries to address these issues. The initial goals have been fulfilled and an
extensible, adaptive and modular solution has been proposed.

## Role of web-based solutions in GUI development

The web-based approach is the trending solution in building graphical user
interfaces for web browsers, desktops and mobile phones. There are strong
reasons behind that - the applications are portable, may easily be adjusted
for diffrent devices and screen sizes, tons of libraries and frameworks are
available and applications may be developed using diffrent styles, like
object-oriented or functional programming. The web applications are fast to
prototype due to the use of declarative HTML and styling with CSS.

This has been verified during TangoJS development. TODO.

**Framework-less solutions.**
From many available frontend frameworks, like Angular or React, TangoJS chooses
none. Developing even complex web applications usig plain DOM APIs is possible
nowadays. Features once available only in libraries like jQuery have been
incorporated into the DOM. HTML5 supports native drag-and-drops and recent
emergence of *Web Components* standard is going to put a definitive end of
monolithic web applications. The componentized approach is already used in
frameworks like Angular 2, React or Polymer, but *Web Components* allow to
acheive the same effects, when not being tied to any particular framework.
The component-based web applications are more maintainable than classic
MVC applications.

**Componentized approach.**
TODO.
