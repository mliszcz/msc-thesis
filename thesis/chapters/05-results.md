# Results

This chapter discusses the outcomes of the presented work, reviews fullfilment
of initial goals and summarizes achievements. TangoJS is compared to existing
solutions and it's usability and usefulness in web development is evaluated.

## Goals review

Goals formulated initially has not been in a form of a strict, measurable
requirements. It was rather a set of design principles and and advices to
follow during the project development. **All the goals have been achieved.**

The main reason behind TangoJS development was to provide **simple, yet
extnsible and flexible** solution for building web-based client applications
for TANGO Control System. This has been reflected in design decisions, software
architecture, platform choice and even the distribution model. Below are
highlighted areas where most focus has been put into.

**User experience.**
TODO.

**Adaptability.**
TODO.

**Simplicity.**
TangoJS is simple to start with and has a minimal learning curve. Only general
knowledge of web development is required to create own applications. There
are no third-party frameworks involved and the set of dependencies is kept
minimal. All components from the TangoJS stack have been deployed to the npm.
Thus, inclusion of TangoJS is as simple as adding a new dependency to the
project. Developers new to TangoJS may choose to start with an blank web
application template available in TangoJS repositories.

**Extensibility.**
TODO.

**Standards-driven.**
TODO.

## Compared to existing solutions

TangoJS may be used as a frontend for any of existing backend solutions,
including *Tango REST*, *Taurus Web* or *mTango*. In case of *mTango* it may be
used as a replacement for it's native frontend layer.
