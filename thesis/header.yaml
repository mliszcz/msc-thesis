abstract: >
  TANGO Control System is a system designed to control *devices* in a
  distributed environment, widely used in automation industry and scientific
  facilities. The hardware is controlled by operators, using many graphical
  applications. Providing usability and ease of access has become a crucial
  part in design and development of modern GUIs. The web-based approach to
  GUI development has emerged recently to meet these requirements.
  However, TANGO, as a CORBA-based software, cannot benefit from this new
  approach. This thesis presents the **TangoJS** - a modular, extensible
  software stack for building TANGO client applications using the latest web
  standards.
