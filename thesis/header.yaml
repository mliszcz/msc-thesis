abstract: >

  Hardware installations in natural sciences and industry are becoming more and
  more complex. This raised a need for more sophisticated methods of control
  over growing number of devices. To address these needs, the **TANGO Control
  System** has been developed at ESRF as a generic framework for building
  distributed control systems. TANGO allows building graphical control panels
  composed of various widgets. As TANGO is a CORBA-based software, these client
  applications can run only on desktop.


  Recently,
  thanks to their numerous benefits over conventional desktop applications,
  **web applications** are more and more widely utilized in different areas.
  Among a few attempts of moving TANGO applications to the web browsers, none
  gained popularity and wide adoption. Most projects have been abandoned
  reaching only a proof-of-concept stage.


  In this thesis we present **TangoJS**, a modular, extensible software stack
  for building TANGO client applications. TangoJS addresses faults and
  drawbacks of existing solutions. Its architecture is layered for increased
  flexibility and easier maintenance. Multiple backend modules are supported,
  which allows accessing TANGO infrastructure using different technologies and
  protocol. TangoJS' Programmable API uses well-defined abstractions and
  interfaces from TANGO IDL specification. Web application developers are
  provided with a set of configurable widgets, which are building blocks for
  more complex user interfaces.
  TangoJS has been designed in compliance with the latest web standards and
  componentization in mind.
  Use of frontend technologies allows building adaptive user interfaces,
  where widget's sizing and layout depends on context. Other than that,
  TangoJS provides an interactive application that allows manually manipulating
  its interface at runtime.
