## Abstract

TANGO Control System is a system designed to control *devices* in a
distributed environment, widely used in automation industry and scientific
facilities. The hardware is controlled by operators, using many graphical
applications. Providing usability and ease of access has become a crucial
part in design and development of modern GUIs. The web-based approach to
GUI development has emerged recently to meet these requirements.
However, TANGO, as a CORBA-based software, cannot benefit from this new
approach. This thesis presents the **TangoJS** - a modular, extensible
software stack for building TANGO client applications using the latest web
standards.
