Scientific and industrial hardware installations are becoming more and more
complex and require sophisticated methods of control. To address these needs,
Tango Controls system has been developed. As Tango is a CORBA-based software,
the developers cannot build control applications using web technologies.
Recently the TangoJS project has been developed as an attempt to integrate
Tango with web browsers. This paper describes the TangoJS' design and
architecture, evaluates TangoJS against existing solutions,
presents a case study of building an interactive control-panel application
and discusses possible production-grade deployment scenarios for TangoJS
applications.
