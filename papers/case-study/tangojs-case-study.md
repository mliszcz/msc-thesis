# Building a web-based control panel

There were many attempts to allow building web-based client applications for
Tango, including Canone [], GoTan [], Taurus Web [], mTango [].
In [] the TangoJS project has been presented.
In this paper, we show how to use TangoJS  develop a web-based control panel
application. The following sections provide introduction to TangoJS development,
formulate control panel requirements, present development process step-by-step
and give an overview of configuration and deployment process.

## TangoJS introduction

TangoJS framework takes a novel approach to address the problem of integrating
Tango Controls with web browser environments.
